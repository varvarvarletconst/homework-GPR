README for the file pseudo-strFind:
the aim is to recreate the function str.find() using only cycles, indexes, slicing and simple math. it finds the first index of the intersection of the string needle with a string haystack. it's not allowed to use str.xxx() 

usage: 
call out the function
give the value of the needle variable -- that's the substring we are looking for
give the value of the haystack variable -- that's the group of symbols (the string) where we are looking for the substring 
the output is the least significant number of the needle in haystack or -1 if there is no such a intersection 

for example:
input:
    needle: мама
    haystack: амама
output:
    1
